##Connecting C and python

This repository contains an implementation of molecular dynamics simulation by connecting python, and c, using c types. Ability to connect python to a faster programming language such as C is crucial in today's world. Where most of the machine learning problems are being solved in python. So whenever it gets slow, write a module in c, expose as a sharable C instance and call it.
